# Image Converter

This software converts input image to the desired format extention
in the destiny folder chosen by the user.
It also admits compresssion options.

Written in Python and Pillow. 

## Features

Some of the implemented features:

- format extention selectable by user;
- single and recursive folder exploration;
- cloned subfolder tree and organization in output;
- compression adjustable by user;
- 4th image channel (*albedo*) erasing.


## Requirements

- Python 3
- Bash or equivalent shell.


## Installation


<details>
<summary>
Windows
</summary>



```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Linux
</summary>

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</details>


## Usage and options

So far it's can only be used with Python interpreter:

```bash
py main.py <arguments> 
```

Source options
</summary>

The easier way to work is searching images by file extention in a specified folder:


|short | long | explanation | default value|
|---|----|---|---|
|`-sf`|`--src-folder`| source folder's path|`.` |
|`-se`|`--src-ext`| source image's extention|`.webp`|
|`-r`|`--recursive`| recursive image search in source folder | disabled |

The alternative way by a list of image paths, in that case the other input options are disabled.

|short | long | explanation | 
|---|----|---|
|`-si`|`--src-images`| image list|

<summary>
Output options
</summary>

The available options for output images are:

|short | long | explanation | default value| 
|---|----|---|---|
|`-df`|`--dst-folder`|destination folder's path|`converted-images` folder inside user directory |
|`-de`|`--dst-ext`|destination image's extention|`.jpg`|
|`-k`|`--keep-tree`| keep input folder's tree at output (only for recursive search)| disabled |
|`-q`|`--quality`| image quality   |`95`| 

Quality option enables output image compression but degrading image. By default is 95 (very slow losses). It can be between 1 and 100.
However not all formats can be compressed (see [Annex](#annex-image-formats)).

## Annex: image formats


### JPG

JPG images are very good for portraits, landscapes and drawings.
Some of its properties:
 
- lossy format image;
- supports image compression;
- widely used and highly compatibility.


### PNG

PNG images are very good for technical schemas, diagrams, window screenshots, etc;
however is often used for portraits, landscapes and drawings.
Some of its properties:

- lossless format image;
- doesn't support image compression;
- supports 4th channel image (*albedo*).
- widely used and highly compatibility.

**Warning:** PNG diagrams could be degraded when are converted to other formats,
specially colours could be changed.


### WEBP

WEBP is a newer image format trying to overcome JPG and PNG formats.
Some of its properties:

- supports lossless and lossy image compression;
- better quality image and lower space disk than JPG at high compression rates (*lossy*);
- lower image size than PNG with *lossless* compression - around 25% less;
- supports 4th channel image (*albedo*).
- not so extended use and compatibility as JPG and PNG but rising.


This program **only does lossy** compression during conversion.
